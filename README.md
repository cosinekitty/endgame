# Chess Endgame Database Generator

This is a demo of an algorithm for generating and using chess endgame databases.

The directory `generate` contains C++ code that generates the endgame databases. In Linux, use the bash script `generate/build` to compile the C++ code. In Windows, use the Visual Studio solution `windows/endgame/endgame.sln`.

The directory `web` contains a browser-based demo of using the generated databases.

Here is a hosted version of the [live demo that forces checkmate](https://doncross.net/endgame/) in an optimal number of moves.
